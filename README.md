## University Application Searcher

## Inspiration
Finding university programs to apply to can be a daunting task - that's why we created the **University Application Searcher!** We hope that we can help other high school students discover university programs with UAS!

## What it does

Enter a university (optional), programs you're interested in, and your course marks. We will provide you with a list of programs that you can apply to (and hopefully get accepted to)!

## How we built it

We used HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript for our website. We used Flask and Python for our web API.

## Challenges we ran into

It took a considerable amount of time for us to lock in our project idea and move forward with something we all wanted to create. Creating and formatting our website was tedious with our web framework and getting javascript to work alongside it. Our web API was also difficult to work with and took a long process to complete.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We worked our hardest to showcase what we have done in the short amount of time that we were given. Although it may not be perfect, we are proud of how much we have achieved.

## What we learned

Many of us were not familiar with the technologies that we used, but we worked with what we had and that brought us this far. We discovered that teamwork and collaboration played a major role in creating our project, as well as getting to know our strengths and weakness. 

## What's next for University Application Searcher

We hope that we can expand on our project in the future and integrate numerous other technologies into our website. We know that UAS has some shortcomings and not everything is polished and complete, but we look forward to addressing those issues and improving on the work that we had done.
